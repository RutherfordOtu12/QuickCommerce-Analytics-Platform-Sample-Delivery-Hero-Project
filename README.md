# QuickShop-Analytics-Platform-Sample-Delivery-Hero-Project
A comprehensive data analytics project demonstrating SQL, Python, visualization, and AI/automation skills for the Delivery Hero

# Project Overview

QuickShop Analytics is a complete business intelligence platform built to simulate real-world analytics workflows for a quick commerce business. The project showcases end-to-end data analysis capabilities, from database design and SQL querying to advanced Python analytics and interactive dashboard development.

This project directly addresses the key requirements outlined in the Delivery Hero job posting, demonstrating proficiency in SQL, Python coding, data visualization, and the application of AI/automation tools to make analytics routines smarter and faster.

# Key Features

The platform encompasses five major components that work together to provide comprehensive business intelligence:

# Database & Data Pipeline:
A fully normalized MySQL database (with SQLite alternative) featuring eight interconnected tables containing 25,000 orders, 5,000 customers, 144 active shops, and 179 products across eight categories. The production-ready schema uses proper data types (DECIMAL for currency, DATETIME for timestamps), InnoDB engine for ACID compliance, foreign key constraints, and strategic indexes for optimal query performance. The synthetic dataset realistically models Delivery Hero's Local Shops business with proper relationships and enterprise-grade design.

# SQL Analytics:
Over 20 production-ready SQL queries organized into six categories covering business performance metrics, customer analytics, product performance, shop analytics, operational efficiency, and data quality monitoring. The queries demonstrate advanced SQL techniques including window functions, common table expressions, cohort analysis, and self-joins for cross-sell analysis.

# Python Data Analysis:
Comprehensive Python scripts implementing time series analysis with moving averages, customer cohort retention analysis, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation, product basket analysis, and geographic performance visualization. All analysis outputs are automatically saved as both CSV files and publication-quality visualizations.

# AI-Powered Automation: 
Two automated analytics systems that run independently to detect anomalies and forecast demand. The anomaly detection system uses statistical methods to identify unusual patterns in revenue, order volume, customer behavior, inventory levels, and delivery performance. The demand forecasting system employs moving averages and trend analysis to predict product demand and generate automated reorder recommendations.

# Interactive Dashboard:
A modern web application built with React and TypeScript featuring a data brutalism design aesthetic. The dashboard provides real-time access to key performance indicators, visualizations, SQL query documentation, AI insights, and comprehensive project documentation.
